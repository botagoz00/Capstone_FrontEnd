# 🍋 Little Lemon Restaurant Website

A responsive multi-page React web application allowing users to explore the Little Lemon restaurant and make table reservations.

---

## 🧭 Project Overview

This project consists of:

- A **Homepage** where users can learn about the restaurant and click a “Book a Table” or “Reservations” button.  
- A **Booking Page** with a reservation form (date, time, guests, occasion) and real-time validation.  
- A **Confirmation Page** after successful booking.  
- Additional reusable components for navigation, layout, styling and accessibility.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- Responsive design that works across mobile, tablet and desktop.  
- Client-side form validation (date cannot be in the past, guests count, valid email etc.).  
- Dynamic booking times (updates as date changes).  
- Accessible UI using semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.  
- Navigation between pages via React Router.  
- Modular React component architecture.  
- Unit tests for validation logic and components.
